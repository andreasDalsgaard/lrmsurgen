LRMS UR Generator.

Program for generating usage records form LRMS information.

Currently Maui is supported.


Installation:

python setup.py install

mkdir /etc/lrmsurgen/
cp examples/* /etc/lrmsurgen/

# edit the two files and set values

add lrms-ur-generator to cron.hourly

# check /var/log/lrmsurgen.log after invokation
# generated urs will be in /var/spool/usagerecords/ or a custom dir set with logdir

Make cron invoke lrms-ur-registrant hourly.


Development:

Start by reading lrms-ur-generator to get a feel of the thing.

See lrmsurgen/maui.py for how the maui generation was done.

See lrmsurgen/usagerecord.py for UR generation details.
