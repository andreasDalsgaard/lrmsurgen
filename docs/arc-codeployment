This document describes how to setup the LRMS UR Generator tool


# The problem

multiple places generates records and registeres thems
this leads to double accounting
we cannot only have lrms logging as the grid middleware has much more information


# How the duplicate detection works.

we want grid records to overwrite lrms records as they have more information.

the duplicate detection is done in postgres database (not supported in the CouchDB backend)


# What must be set

the hostname setting must be identical, so all records are registered with the same machine name.
