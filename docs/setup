This document describes how to setup the LRMS UR Generator tool.

The tool consists of two programs/scripts:

lrms-ur-generator  : Creates usage records by parsing LRMS logs.
lrms-ur-registrant : Registers usage records to SGAS.

Both programs should be invoked regularly by CRON or similar. None of the
programs are daemons.


== Requirements ==

* Python 2.4 or later
* Twisted Core and Web (http://twistedmatrix.com/)
* PyOpenSSL (https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl)

Typical package names: python-twisted python-twisted-web python-openssl


== Installation ==

$ sudo python setup.py install
$ mkdir /etc/lrmsurgen/
$ cp examples/* /etc/lrmsurgen/

Edit the two configuration files and set value accordingly

Add lrms-ur-generator to cron.hourly / crontab
The scripts does not need to run hourly, it is just recommended.

The lrms-ur-generator tool can also be invoked manually to test it (note that
it will still write to the logfile).

Check /var/log/lrmsurgen.log after invokation
Generated urs will be in /var/spool/usagerecords/ (or a custom logdir setting)

Having verified that the logger work, add lrms-ur-registrant to cron.hourly / crontab.

The programs does not need to run as root as such, however:
lrms-ur-generator  : requires read access to the maui workload traces.
lrms-ur-registrant : requires read access to host key and certificate
If running as another user the spool directory will probably have to created
manually.
